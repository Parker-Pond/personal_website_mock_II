        <p>
          Raised in Las Vegas and I am currently living in Provo Utah with my
          beautiful wife and a child on the way. We love living so close to the
          mountains and trails, the food here is also excellent, with the local
          restaurant and farmers market scenes. (I might be a foody, but that
          also comes with me bringing in baked goods to work, so… you have been
          warned.)

          From a young age I was taught the value of effort and how to run a
          business. These skills tend to get me moved to management positions,
          in which I do very well, but I am just as content working under
          someone and in a team. Years of customers service, sales, and general
          extravertedness has given me a skill for figuring out what a customer
          needs and how to get them the closes thing. This has given me an
          ability to work with difficult and angry customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years of sales, food, and applied behavior analytics (quite a
          different field I know), I have developed these skills and am very
          good at them, but just because you are good at something does not mean
          you enjoy doing said thing. I have been working on changing careers
          but figuring out which one has been hard, but then I remembered the
          love I had for computer programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found computer programming in high school where I joined a club and
          fell in love. After a year the club disbanded and school took over,
          but I always remembered how much I loved it. In May of 2023 I decided
          to take the plunge and try my hand at web development, and I fell in
          love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended Fullstack academies’ full stack development course and
          loved every minute of it. My free time was full of learning new things
          and I drank in the lessons we had. I had forgotten what it was like to
          love what you do, not just be so good at something that people
          automatically thought you must love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pride myself on being a lifetime learner and the tech industry is
          perfect for that, as it is constantly evolving, I am never going to
          run out of new things to learn, and even things I do know are going to
          evolve so I can learn more on them.
